Hi!  I'm Connor Rapelje (he/him/his) and I am a second-year Computer Science major at UCSB.  I took CS32 in the spring and am enthusiastic to be able to
help everyone as you continue to study Computer Science and C++ this quarter.  I really enjoyed taking this course and look forward to reliving the glory days of CS32 with you.
Outside of academia I am a member of the Gaucho Gaming club as I enjoy playing a fair amount of video games in my free time.  I mainly play League of Legends, Apex Legends,
and World of Warcraft.  I am always happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have, even if you think it's a "dumb" question.  
I myself ask a lot of what I deem "dumb" questions so there won't be any judgements here.  I will try to respond as fast as I can.  I am a bit of a night owl so if you ever think it's too late to ask a question, I will probably
still be awake and more than happy to answer.  My number one priority for this class is making sure that you understand the material so please if you 
have any questions don't hesitate to contact me and I look forward to trying to figure out all sorts of errors with you all.
