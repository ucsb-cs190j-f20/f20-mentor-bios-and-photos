Hi! My name is Bethany, I am a third year Computer Engineering major, and I'm excited to be a ULA for CS24 this quarter. I personally really enjoyed taking CS24 and found the concepts taught to be fun to implement and interesting, so I'm hoping to help you all get through some of the frustrating bugs and complicated topics so you can have some fun with the class as well. 

Outside of tutoring, I'm also currently working at a telehealth startup in SB as a devops intern, I'm a member of the STEM sorority Phi Sigma Rho, and I was a part of the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) last year working under Prof. Diba Mirza and Prof. Tim Sherwood on computer architecture security research. For fun I love to go to the beach, go hiking, and other outdoors-ey things :) If you want to talk about any of these areas/interests shoot me an email at bethanylong@ucsb.edu! 

I'm excited to get to know you all throughout the quarter, good luck everyone!
