Hi all! My name is Tanay and I’m a fourth year computer science student. I'm really excited to be able to tutor for CS 156 this quarter. I took CS 56 in Fall 2019 with Professor Conrad and continued to work under him over the course of the year exploring testing practices in Spring Boot and React. It’s my second time being a LA for this course and I'm looking forward to working on the projects at the end of the year. Other than web development, I also enjoy applying and learning about machine learning and natural language processing. Outside of classes, I love to read, play Smash Ultimate and backpacking. Please do no hesitate to reach out to me with any of your questions!
