Hello everyone! My name is Sara (she/her/hers) and I am a second year mathematical science major. This is my first time tutoring, but I am thrilled to work with you guys as this was a course that got me really excited. I had taken a few computer science classes in high school, but CS8 was the first programming course I really enjoyed and it is what got me very interested in the subject. Taking this course inspired me to start participating in more computer science related activities like enrolling in courses that weren't a part of my major requirements and joining extracurriculars. I hope to show you all how fun and rewarding computer science can be and get you just as interested in the field as I am. I know computer science can seem a bit challenging and intimidating at first, especially if you're in the same situation that I was where you're not a computer science major or have very little experience in the subject. I am here to help though in any way I can. I'll try to answer any questions you have on Piazza, in lab, or in office hours and direct you to someone else for any questions I don't know the answer to. In addition to being a tutor, I am also on the executive board for WiCS (Women in Computer Science) and I work as an organizer for SB Hacks (UCSB's annual hackathon). If you have any questions about either of those organizations or how you can get involved with computer science when it isn't your major, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm always happy to chat. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, golfing, cooking, and just being outdoors. I look forward to getting to know you all and hope you have a great quarter.
