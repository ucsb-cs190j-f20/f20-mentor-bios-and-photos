Hello everyone, my name is Kobe Shavolian (he/him/his) and I am a 3rd-year Computer Science major here at UCSB!
I’m super excited to be a tutor for this course as it was one of my favorite CS classes I took so far.
CS24 taught me the foundation of thinking like a problem solver and introduced me to concepts that help me solve problems today.
As a student who transferred from being a Math major, I hope to provide explanations for students with little programming experience
as well as higher-level concepts for those who do have experience.
We all start somewhere, so I want to cater to every audience and provide as much support as I can!
As mentioned, I was previously a Math major who was accepted into the College of Engineering so I can offer to answer any questions related to that process.
I can also talk about clubs (such as the Data Science club) or sources outside UCSB if students want to further their independent knowledge on any subject. 
Beyond academics, I enjoy playing games, going to the gym, watching Netflix (of course), and building computers!
Feel free to reach out to me for any questions and I’ll do my best to answer, hope to have a great quarter!
