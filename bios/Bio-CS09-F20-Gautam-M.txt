Hey everyone! My name is Gautam (he/him/his) and I’m a third year Computer Science Major here at UCSB. I’m super excited to be a LA for CS9 this quarter and I look forward to learning as much as I can while helping everyone do their best in the class. CS9 is a brand-new course offered this fall by prof Richert Wang, who has worked hard to make the class super interesting! If you’re interested in learning more about data structures and algorithms in Python–this is the course to be in! Besides my duties as an LA and a full time Computer Science student, I love to paint in my free time! Check out more of my work at @gpm.paints. Finally, if any of you want to chat about school, advice about landing internships, or just want to meet someone new, shoot me an email and I would be more than happy to set up a Zoom call. Hope you all stay safe and have an amazing Fall quarter :)
