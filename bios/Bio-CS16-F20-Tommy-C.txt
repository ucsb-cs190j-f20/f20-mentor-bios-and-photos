Hey everyone! I’m Tommy Chao (he/him/his), and I am a third-year computer science major! I am excited to tutor for CS16 because I really enjoyed taking this class during my first quarter at UCSB. This is likely the first class you are taking which teaches C++, and C++ is widely used throughout UCSB’s CS courses. Because of this, I am eager to help out and strengthen your C++ fundamentals so you will succeed in future classes!

One great thing about being a ULA is that it helps bridge the gap between students and instructors/TAs. If you are hesitant about asking for help from the TAs or instructors, I would be more than happy to help as a fellow peer! My office hours are Thursday from 3:00 to 5:00pm and my Zoom link is available on Gauchospace. Even if you don’t have any questions to ask, feel free to stop by my office hours to have a chat! I will also be available to help via email or Piazza.

A bit of background about me is that I used to volunteer for my local library teaching the elderly how to use computers. I would teach them basic computer skills such as using Microsoft Office, checking news, and using social media. Getting to know a lot of people in my community and helping them succeed while volunteering here gave me a great sense of satisfaction and was the main inspiration I had for becoming a tutor. Now, I am even more eager to tutor in a field that I am passionate about!

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing video games! Minecraft, Pokémon Go, and Overwatch are among my favorites, although there are too many to list. (Pokémon Go at UCSB campus is a great experience, by the way ;) )

I am excited to meet everyone and I hope we all have a great quarter together!
