Hello! I'm Connor McIntosh (he/him/his) I'm a third year Computer Science major from Ventura, CA. I took CS64 last winter, I had a lot of fun and I think you will too. This is my first quarter as a ULA but I'm excited to learn the ropes and help you all throughout the quarter. I'm into data science and music. I play the drums (jazz/latin/funk) in ensembles on and off campus and I’m a part of the Data Science club. I started out at UCSB as a physics major but I completed the process of switching into the College of Engineering so feel free to ask me any questions about that process. My office hours are Fridays 9am - 11am Pacific and the zoom link is on the course’s Gauchospace page. Feel free to drop by to just get work done or to ask any questions you have. Stay safe, stay healthy, and let’s have a great quarter!
