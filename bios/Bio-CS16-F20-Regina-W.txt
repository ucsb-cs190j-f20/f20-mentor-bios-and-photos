Hi! I’m Regina (she/her/hers), a fourth year CS major, and this is my second time tutoring for CS16. 
Whether you’re taking this class for your major, or just for fun, I hope that after this quarter you get better idea of what CS is and feel more confident with coding!
As a tutor, I hope that I can help you develop skills like debugging and critical thinking when it comes to coding. 
Other than tutoring, I’m currently interning at a company in SB, working on my senior capstone project, and am an active member in my engineering sorority Phi Sigma Rho. 
My hobbies include rollerskating, board games, and trying out new recipes! Feel free to reach out to me about advice in the CS major!
