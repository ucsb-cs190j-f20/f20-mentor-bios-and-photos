Hey everyone, my name is Alyssa!!! My pronouns are she/her/hers and I’m a third-year Statistics and Data Science Major with a minor 
in Geographical Spatial Science. I’m so excited to be tutoring for the first time in CS90DA!!! When I took this class last fall with 
Prof K, I was a pre-math major. After realizing I liked coding and analyzing data, I decided to change my major to data science :)
CS90DA is a very cool class geared towards students who have little to no experience coding. Despite coming in with limited knowledge 
of coding, this class made me a lot more confident and I was able to breeze through my other computer science classes.As a former 
student of this class, one piece of advice I can give you is that you should always ask for help. When it comes to coding, there are 
no dumb questions. The teaching staff is still learning so anything and anyone can improve. One thing I love about data science is 
that it is interdisciplinary. Whether you are a humanities major or working towards medical school, data is everywhere. I believe anyone 
inquisitive, is hard-working, and loves solving problems can be a data scientist. Outside of school, I like to play tennis, go to the beach, 
play with my dogs, and watch Korean Dramas. I’m also the publicity chair for Iaorana Te Otea, UCSB’s Polynesian Dance and Drumming Club. We 
offer many opportunities for dancers and drummers to learn about Polynesian culture and perform. Having taken this class before, I hope I 
can provide the best advice and help guide you in the right direction towards solving a problem. If you have any questions, feel free to 
reach out to me directly on piazza or during our lab/lecture zoom sessions!!! I look forward to meeting many of you this quarter!!!!
