Hi! I'm Ari (he/him/his), a third year CS and Statistics & Data Science double major with a minor in Physics. I'm from Uruguay, a small country in South America, and came to the US to pursue my studies. This is my first time as a ULA, and I'm very happy to share it with all of you. I'm excited about CS64 because it was a class that gave me a lot of intuition about how things actually work in a computer, as opposed to just using a high-level language without knowing how anything works in the background. My hope is that you can all get some of that intuition, and that we can all learn together!  I'm happy to help you with anything inside or outside class, related to CS64 or not. Outside of class, I enjoy hanging out with friends, reading, going on random adventures, and going to the gym. I'm also especially interested in data science and machine learning, so if you ever feel like talking about that, come to my Peer Mentor Session! You can always reach me on Piazza or via email :)
