Previous experience as a tutor: ULA for CS8 
Hey everyone :) I’m a third year CS major. CS8 was my first CS class at UCSB and I remember being so afraid coming to class as a freshman. I thought that everyone knew so much more than I did and I felt so intimidated. If you feel this way trust me you are not alone. With the help of great professors and tutors who helped me feel welcome I improved so much in my abilities and gained a lot of confidence. I’m excited to be a tutor because I want to do the same and make you realize how interesting and rewarding coding is. I know that the course is fast paced and in moments you might feel extremely overwhelmed, but I, along with an amazing staff of TA’s, tutors, and a stellar professor, am more than eager to help. I want to share some tricks that I found helpful when taking CS8 and help you see that you can do it. I know that people think of CS as being extremely difficult and stressful, but I want to help you see how fun it can actually be. If you have any questions in regards to course material, study methods, tips I have for being successful in this class, or if you just want to talk feel free to reach out to me. I’m a super friendly and social person and am always open to conversation. Outside of school I love playing volleyball and play for the UCSB women’s club volleyball team so you might see me at East Beach. Other than volleyball I love to paint (although I am not the best at it) and I love to travel. I look forward to meeting you all and I hope that this quarter will be an awesome experience.
