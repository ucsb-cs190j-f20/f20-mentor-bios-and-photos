Hi all! My name is Gabriel and I’m a third year computer science student. This quarter I’m super excited to be tutoring for CS 156. It’s my first time being a LA for this course, so I’m excited to both help everyone else in the class succeed, and learn the ins and outs of the course myself. I used to be a math major, so therefore I tend to enjoy algorithms, computational theory, et cetera. Outside of my classes, I’m really into combining CS with art and music--right now, I’m building LED displays/installations that combine light and color with real-time music visualization. I’m also into fitness, backpacking, dance, and the wilderness, and try to spend as much time as I can away from the city off on adventures! I’m really excited to get to know as many of you as I can this quarter; please reach out to me if you have any questions about, well, anything, really.
